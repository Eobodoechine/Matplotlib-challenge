In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 
Cleaned data and generated a summary statistics table, bar plot that shows the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen,  pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculated the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
Generated a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers.
Selected a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.
Generated a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen
Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plotted the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
